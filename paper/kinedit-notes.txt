errors in same file in one editor with code folding
marks are good way to recenter editor on error if lost

iterate through process twice (determine name and rename)

replace lots of errors next to each other
editor obscures fact that in same file / same part of code

problems with no tool
  lots of clicking even with find references
  distinguish between existing errors and errors from rename

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

observations:
- right clicked to try to open kin
- kin took many seconds to open
- didn't use kin to determine name
- made several passes to look at usages
- "would be nice if could open all errors" (having used non-tool first)
- used declaration only to determine name
- used errors to iterate through and copy paste

comments and improvements:
- too much info...too many windows "unconventional user interface"
- did not need surrounding context (before after error). instead line by line
- awkward to go to first error then open
- rather do through eclipse's built in refactoring tool
- give confirmation when error is gone; show progress
- open declaration at top
- needs easier, quicker navigation
- edit all names at once (replace usages)
- have to trust tool is finding all references (have to trust errors)

study design

- merge errors in same file to one editor

- give confirmation when error is gone; show progress

- several obvious improvements performance, right click,
punchy sentence
